        <h1>What is Climb For Your World?</h1>
        <div class="intro-text centre-text">
        <p>Climb For Your World is WWF's new virtual fundraising event. It uses a mobile app called <a href="https://www.strava.com/" target="_blank">Strava</a> to track your activity and utilises the <a href="https://www.justgiving.com" target="_blank">JustGiving</a> platform to collect donations. You make the decisions. Choose to hike, cycle or run – setting a timeframe of 2, 4, 6 or 8 weeks – whichever suits your activity level the most. On your journey to the summit you can unlock inspiring WWF videos, simply by setting your own fundraising target; the minimum is as little as £5.</p><p>Whatever your age and fitness level, you can Climb For Your World – simply choose the pace, place and your fundraising target. Your virtual challenge will take you through some of the most spectacular, yet threatened, places in the world showing you why we all need to fight to protect our world.</p><h2>Get active and get outdoors</h2><p>Discover the hills, peaks and mountains in your local area and start ascending! The only rule is that your activity must be on an incline to make progress on your climb up the mountain (walking on the flat doesn’t count!) All you need is a smartphone and the <a href="https://www.strava.com/mobile" target="_blank">Strava App</a> or a Strava-compatible smartwatch and the determination to reach the summit and raise vital funds for WWF!</p><p>Signing up to Climb For Your World is free but we do encourage you to raise as much as you can to help support WWF’s vital mountain gorilla conservation work. You'll receive a few motivational emails to help you get fundraising and inspire you to climb.</p><h2>Explore Mount Sabyinyo and climb for mountain gorillas</h2><p>The first Climb For Your World challenge will take you up virtually to the top of Mount Sabyinyo. It is an extinct volcano in a chain of volcanoes in East-Central Africa known as the Virunga Massif. The summit of the mountain, at 3,645 metres marks the intersection of the borders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, and Uganda. You’ll be ascending 1,200 metres to reach the peak of Mount Sabyinyo.</p><p>The slopes of this mountain are a habitat for the critically endangered mountain gorilla. Although mountain gorillas are the only great ape thought to be increasing in number, there are only about 1,000 left in the wild. Serious threats remain, including from habitat destruction and disease and indirectly from poaching as snares set for other animals may injure or even kill mountain gorillas. The time to protect them is now. Their future is fragile.</p><p>The money you raise with Climb For Your World will help fund our work through the International Gorilla Conservation Programme which seeks to secure a future for mountain gorillas and their habitat whilst making sure that local people gain benefit from living in close proximity to gorillas.</p><p><a href="/campaign/yv3YWLZMVm">Take me to Climb For Your World</a></p><h2>Got more questions?</h2><p>For more information please visit our <a href="/campaign/yv3YWLZMVm/faq">FAQ page</a>.</p>
