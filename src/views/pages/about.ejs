        <h1>What is Climb For Your World?</h1>
        <div class="intro-text centre-text">
        <p>Climb For Your World is WWF's virtual fundraising event. It uses the mobile app called Strava which tracks your activity and the JustGiving platform to collect donations. Anyone can take part. Whatever your age and fitness level, simply choose the pace, place and your fundraising target. Throughout your challenge, you’ll unlock exclusive content which shows you some of the most spectacular, yet threatened, places in the world and why we need you to help us protect them.
        </p>
        <p>
        You make the decisions!
        <ul>
          <li>Choose your activity: hike, run or cycle</li>
          <li>Select your timeframe: 2, 4, 6 or 8 weeks</li>
          <li>Set your fundraising target: the minimum is as little as £5</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2>Get active and get outdoors</h2>
        <p>Discover the hills, peaks and mountains in your local area (or further afield) and start ascending! The only rule is that your activity must be on an incline to make progress up the virtual mountain (walking on the flat doesn’t count!) All you need is a smartphone or a Strava-compatible smartwatch and the Strava App to start tracking your climb.
        </p>
        <h2>Fundraise</h2>
        <p>Signing up to Climb For Your World is free but we encourage you to raise as much as you can to help support WWF’s vital conservation work. Share your progress with friends and family and ask them to donate to your climb. You'll receive motivational emails to help you get started but if you want to go bigger with your fundraising and need more support, please get in touch at <a href="mailto:fundraising@wwf.org.uk" class="link">fundraising@wwf.org.uk</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>The first challenge</h2>
        <p>The first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DjGR_QY10&feature=youtu.be" class="link" target="_blank">Climb For Your World challenge</a> takes you virtually up to the top of Mount Sabyinyo. It is an extinct volcano in a chain of volcanoes in East-Central Africa known as the Virunga Massif. The summit of the mountain, at 3,645 metres marks the intersection of the borders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, and Uganda. You’ll be ascending 1,200 metres to reach the peak of Mount Sabyinyo.
        </p>
        <p>The slopes of this mountain are a habitat for the critically endangered mountain gorilla. Although mountain gorillas are the only great ape thought to be increasing in number, there are only about 1,000 left in the wild. Serious threats remain, including from habitat destruction and disease and indirectly from poaching as snares set for other animals may injure or even kill mountain gorillas. The time to protect them is now. Their future is fragile.
        </p>
        <p>The money you raise from the Mount Sabyinyo challenge will help fund our work through the International Gorilla Conservation Programme which seeks to secure a future for mountain gorillas and their habitat, whilst making sure that local people gain benefit from living in close proximity to gorillas.
